                    <p class="text-lg ">
                      SEO refers to the process of optimizing a website to
                      improve its visibility on search engine results pages
                      (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase the quantity and
                      quality of traffic to a website through organic search
                      engine results. This is achieved by optimizing various
                      aspects of the website, including its content, structure,
                      and performance, to make it more attractive to search
                      engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

                          engines. On-page SEO techniques include optimizing
